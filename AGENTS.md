# Donghaeng (동행)

Wedding-journey companion web service for couples — centered on a guest
ledger (하객·좌석·축의금). See README.md for the product pitch.

## Status

Concept stage, aligned (as of 2026-07-26). Vision, core scope, MVP v1
boundary, and product values are decided — see the decision records in
`notes/` (`2026-07-26-decision-core-scope.md`,
`2026-07-26-mvp-v1-requirements.md`). Tech stack and architecture are NOT
yet chosen; success criteria are deliberately deferred until after the MVP
is built. Do not pick a stack or start implementation without the user.

## Product values (apply to every decision)

These two values are the project's standing test for any feature, design,
or code decision:

1. **정직함 · 믿음직함** (honest, trustworthy) — premium-service trust.
   Guest contacts and, later, 축의금 money data are sensitive: security,
   privacy, and never-wrong numbers are requirements, not polish.
2. **깔끔하되 핵심은 다 있게** (clean, yet nothing essential missing) —
   fewer things, each complete. When in doubt, cut scope, not quality.

## Do not reference the prior attempt

This project restarts an earlier wedding-related service, archived at
`archive/experiments/2026-07/wedding-management`. Do not read, port, or take
design/architecture cues from that archive — this is a deliberate fresh start,
not a continuation. If historical context is needed, ask the user directly
rather than inspecting the archive.

## Naming

Brand name: 동행 (Donghaeng) — "walking together," chosen to express the
service acting as a steady companion through the couple's wedding journey.
Repo/folder slug: `donghaeng`.

## Rules

- Language: this file, README.md, notes/, code comments, and scripts are
  English (per workspace convention in the root AGENTS.md). In-app
  user-facing copy will be Korean once built.
- Full engineering discipline applies here per workspace rules for
  `products/`: git repo, README, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, tests — tests apply
  once there is code to test.
- Decisions from alignment conversations are recorded as dated files in
  `notes/` and reflected here when they change standing rules.
